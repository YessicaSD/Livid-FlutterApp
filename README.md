# Livid-FlutterApp
This is a project elaborated by [Yessica Servín](https://github.com/YessicaSD), [Christian Martínez]() and [Alex Morales](https://github.com/AlexMG99) for the thrid assignment of Mobile Devices subject at CITM (Terrassa).

# Introduction
With this app you can manage your life in an entertaining way.
You have different needs that are satisfied as you perform tasks. Each task meets different needs.
The goal is to keep all your needs in balance.
For example, the need for stamina is recovered by performing the sleep task. Or the need for strength that is increased by performing the exercise task.

# App Screens
## User Selection Screen
It is the first screen in appearing. The user has to choose between its user in order to use its own tasks. He/she can use the other users to see what the others are doing.

## User Profile
This screen shows the user profile info, including a picture and the different value of the actual stats (Fun, Intelligence, Stamina, Strength, Social and Hygiene). At the bottom of it, there is the To Do List, where all the tasks that the user is doing are shown. The user can click to edit the information about it and if he/she long presses the task, a pop-up will appear, in order to know if the task is deleted or not. There is a button where a new task can be added to The To Do List.

If you move right, you can see all the tasks that are already done and when they were finished.

## Add Task
In the screen a new task of the Custom task of every user can be selected. When you click one of them, it is added to the To Do List. If you want to delete one, you have to do the same as User Profile screen. If the task that you are doing is not in the list, you can create a new one by clicking in the add button.

## Create Task
The user can custumize its own new task, adding a name, a description an the upgrade that the task will give him. If some parameter is empty when clicking the finish button, the app will request them to be filled.
